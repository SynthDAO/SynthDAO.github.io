# SynthDAO

## Summary
SynthDAO is a collective of product builders creating products and tools for DeFi synthetics and derivatives.

## Team
While the DAO has a relatively flat heirarchy, to avoid the [Tyranny of Structurelessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tyranny_of_Structurelessness) and other [coordination problems](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TxcRbCYHaeL59aY7E/meditations-on-moloch), the DAO relies on pre-agreed upon process, delegation, and a core team that drives the vision and keeps the tempo of product development.

## Product Development Philosophy
Ship fast, ship early, keep funds safe. 

The DAO adopts a fast moving iterative approach to product development, but when it comes to smart contracts holding user funds, errors are not acceptible. Thus any deployed contracts that put users funds at risk are carefully architected and audited before deployment.

In order to validate user traction as early as possible, a "progressive decentralization" strategy is used whereupon early centralization is acceptible for time to market, which will be decentralized as the product gains traction and matures.

## Products
The SynthDAO is currently building or maintaining 3 products in the synth ecosystem:

- Limit Orders for the Synthetix exchange ([SIP-54](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-54) | [Repo](https://github.com/SynthDAO/snx-limit-orders) | Pending Audit)
- [uSynth.xyz]() minting and management interface for UMA synths ([Repo](https://github.com/SynthDAO/usynth) | Live)
- Margin trading system for Synthetix ([Proposal](https://github.com/Synthetixio/snx-grants-dao/pull/31) | R&D)
